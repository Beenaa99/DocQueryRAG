#API Documentation Query System using Agentic RAG

It is an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that simplifies the exploration of API documentation. It scrapes content from user-provided documentation links, processes and structures the data into datasets, and generates embeddings for efficient vector-based retrieval. With its seamless integration of Azure OpenAI and Cosmos DB, it provides precise, context-aware answers to user queries.

This system is perfect for developers looking to streamline their understanding of complex APIs, with features including:

Automatic web scraping and dataset creation from documentation links.
Preprocessing and embedding of scraped content for optimized retrieval.
Vector-based search for similarity matching.
Context-aware answers using state-of-the-art RAG techniques.
A user-friendly interface for managing datasets and querying API documentation.
